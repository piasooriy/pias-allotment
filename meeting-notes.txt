Notes: Today was focused on what out MVP is. 
Folder and repository. 
Planned out “datamodellering” on DB diagram. 

For the next sprint: 
- Folder structure needs to be in place.
- Install sanity under _studio.
- Make schemas
- Deploy to netlify
- Create Prototype
- Set up github projects

Notes: Created Sanity schemas and structure, and deployed it. 
Added grid styling-sheet, which can be used with classnames. 
Made fetch-modules for newsletter, products, etc. 
Rendered newsletter and seedAndSupply. 
Styled the cards for newsletter and frontpage in render. 
We are up and above the MVP which was just to make a list of newsletters.

For the next sprint: 
- Create footer.
- Add mediaQueries
- Make clickable links for the cards which redirects to a new dynamic slug-based window.

Notes: Created Footer. Added mediaQueries to newsletter and product page. 
Made a “on-click-to-new-window” function which suprisingly works. 
Tweaked the page a little more than what was originally in the prototype. 
Decided to not have the shop-version for seed and supply (with add basket and prices). 
But the information is there for scalability purposes. 
Made validation for email-input (would be nice to post to sanity, 
but I don’t think I have the time to do that). 

Last minute touches: 
- Style the slugged-pages.
- Maybe see if I can implement a search function? Highly doubt it, but could be fun to try.
